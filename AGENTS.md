## Overview

I am building a desktop application called "Fast PDF". It is a desktop application that allows user to read, write and modify PDF files.

Your task is to build this application using the best practices and tools available. This app has to be both friendly, intuitive and functional.

I want you to keep using these tools:

- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- React
- LibPDF-js/core (https://github.com/LibPDF-js/core)
- Electron
- Typescript
- Shadcn/UI
- Tanstack Router

## Rules

- Always use `import type` instead of `import` for types imports.
- When dealing with frontend design, follow the overall vibe of the application. Focus to use `frontend-design` skill when you are designing or building the frontend.
