## Overview

I am building a desktop application called "Fast PDF". It is a desktop application that allows user to read, write and modify PDF files.

Your task is to build this application using the best practices and tools available.

I want to to keep using these tools:

- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- React
- LibPDF-js/core (https://github.com/LibPDF-js/core)
- Electron
- Typescript

## Rules

- Always use `import type` instead of `import` for types imports.
- When dealing with frontend design, follow the overall vibe of the application. Focus to use `frontend-design` skill when you are designing or building the frontend.
